    <h2>Overview &amp; Insights</h2>
    <p class="lede">
      I started the analysis by reviewing the dataset on its own, checking for gaps and unusual patterns.
      From there, I compared across multiple dimensions&mdash;time, geography, substances, and demographics&mdash;to address three guiding questions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="questions">
    <h2>Q1: How have yearly overdose deaths changed over time, and what share involve fentanyl?</h2>
    <p><em>Motivation:</em> Having grown up in Philadelphia, I’ve seen how fentanyl reshaped the overdose crisis. Since moving to Pittsburgh, I want to understand whether Allegheny County has experienced a similar trajectory, with fentanyl emerging as a central driver of fatalities.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="A1.png" alt="Bar chart showing most common drugs in overdose incidents; fentanyl, cocaine, heroin dominate." />
      <figcaption>
        The substances most frequently mentioned in overdose cases. Duplicate and inconsistent labels (e.g., “Fentanyl,” “Cocaine; Fentanyl,” and bracketed entries)
        created data quality challenges. Related entries were consolidated and ambiguous categories grouped to reveal the true distribution.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <img src="A2.png" alt="Stacked or grouped chart of incidents by major drug families, highlighting opioids and stimulants." />
      <figcaption>
        Incidents grouped into major drug families. Fentanyl and other opioids dominate, followed by stimulants. Alcohol and benzodiazepines appear less frequently but remain meaningful contributors.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <img src="A3.png" alt="Breakdown of the Other/Adjuncts category into specific medications." />
      <figcaption>
        Breaking down “Other / Adjuncts” shows prescription and over‑the‑counter drugs that contribute to incidents (e.g., antidepressants, sedatives, acetaminophen). Individually smaller, collectively significant.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <img src="A4.png" alt="Line or bar chart of overdose incidents by year with a sharp rise from 2014 and a peak around 2017; most recent year shaded as partial." />
      <figcaption>
        Overdose incidents by year. Relatively steady through 2013, then a sharp rise starting 2014 with a peak in 2017.
        Levels remain well above pre‑2014. The most recent year is partial and shaded to indicate caution in interpretation.
      </figcaption>

  <section class="seasonality">
    <h2>Seasonality</h2>
    <div class="grid-2">
      <figure>
        <img src="A5.png" alt="Incidents by month; modest peaks in April and August, slight dips in winter months." />
        <figcaption>
          Incidents remain relatively steady across the calendar year, with modest peaks in April and August and slightly fewer events in January/November.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img src="A6.png" alt="Incidents by day of month; spike on the 1st likely due to defaulted dates; lower on the 31st." />
        <figcaption>
          Distribution by day of month. A spike on the 1st likely reflects defaulted/missing dates; the 31st is lower since not all months include it.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="geography">
    <h2>Q2: Where are the geographic hotspots, and how often do incidents occur away from home ZIP codes?</h2>
    <p><em>Motivation:</em> In Philadelphia, recognized hotspots shaped resource placement (e.g., Narcan distribution). I examine whether Allegheny County shows similar concentration.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="A7.png" alt="County‑wide map of overdose incidents by ZIP code, showing clustering." />
      <figcaption>
        County‑wide overview of incidents by ZIP code, revealing clear clustering in certain communities.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <img src="A8.png" alt="Refined ZIP‑level choropleth with sharper alignment to boundaries." />
      <figcaption>
        Refining ZIP alignment sharpens local variation, highlighting concentrated risk in specific neighborhoods.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <img src="A9.png" alt="Map annotated with highest and zero‑incident ZIP codes (15210 high; 15261 zero)." />
      <figcaption>
        Emphasizing disparity: 15210 records the highest count, while 15261 reports none&mdash;underlining an uneven burden across the county.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <img src="A10.png" alt="Maps by substance family showing clusters for fentanyl/opioids, stimulants, benzodiazepines, alcohol, and adjuncts." />
      <figcaption>
        Repeated hotspots appear across substance families. Fentanyl/opioids show the largest clusters; stimulants and others are more diffuse but persistent.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </section>

  <section class="demographics">
    <h2>Q3: Which demographic groups (age and race) have been most affected in recent years?</h2>
    <p><em>Motivation:</em> Public discussion often emphasizes disproportionate impacts on certain groups and spread into younger cohorts. Here, I examine local patterns.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="A11.png" alt="Age by year trend showing concentration among adults 25–34 with heavy burdens in 35–44 and 45–54." />
      <figcaption>
        Fatal overdoses are most concentrated among adults 25–34, with heavy burdens among 35–44 and 45–54.
        Youth (&lt;25) and older adults (65+) remain comparatively lower.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <img src="A12.png" alt="Race by year heatmap showing majority of deaths among White residents with increases among Black residents after 2018." />
      <figcaption>
        Deaths are overwhelmingly among White residents, surging through the mid‑2010s and remaining elevated into the early 2020s.
        Black residents show a parallel upward trend with increases after 2018 and peaks around 2020–2021.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </section>

  <section class="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Fatal overdoses in Allegheny County escalated dramatically over the past decade, with fentanyl emerging as the dominant driver since the mid‑2010s.
      Incidents are geographically concentrated&mdash;often in central and river‑adjacent ZIPs&mdash;and frequently involve multiple substances.
      The crisis falls most heavily on working‑age adults (25–44), with men and White residents comprising the largest shares, alongside growing impacts among Black residents in recent years.
      These patterns point to an epidemic that is concentrated and complex&mdash;geographically, demographically, and across substances&mdash;and argue for targeted, community‑specific responses.
